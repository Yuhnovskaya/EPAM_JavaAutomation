The phrase regular expressions, also called regexes, is often used to mean the specific, standard textual
 syntax for representing patterns for matching text, as distinct from the mathematical notation described
 below. Each character in a regular expression (that is, each character in the string describing its pattern)
is either a metacharacter, having a special meaning, or a regular character that has a literal meaning.
For example, in the regex a., a is a literal character which matches just 'a', while '.' is a metacharacter
that matches every character except a newline. Therefore, this regex matches, for example,
'a ', or 'ax', or 'a0'. Together, metacharacters and literal characters can be used to identify
text of a given pattern, or process a number of instances of it. Pattern matches may vary from a precise
 equality to a very general similarity, as controlled by the metacharacters.
The metacharacter syntax is designed specifically to represent prescribed
  targets in a concise and flexible way to direct the automation of text processing of a variety of input
  data, in a form easy to type using a standard ASCII keyboard.
