Race, life's a race
And I am gonna win
Yes, I am gonna win
And I'll light the fuse
And I'll never lose
And I choose to survive
(So I told you)
Whatever it takes
You won't pull ahead
I'll keep up the pace
And I'll reveal my strength
To the whole human race
(You were warned and didn't listen)
Yes I am prepared
To stay alive
I won't forgive, the vengeance is mine
And I won't give in
Because I choose to thrive
